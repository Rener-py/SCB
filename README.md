**Description:**
Embark on an extraordinary journey of spiritual revival with the **Spiritual Come Back** mod! Experience a captivating adventure where death is but a temporary setback, and the realm of spirits beckons, offering unique advantages and supernatural protection.

**Panicked Spirit Effect:** [![spirit_Txt3_scaled_3x_pngcrushed](https://github.com/Rener-py/SCB/assets/47863186/b9e67410-a2ec-47b4-898a-3175aedd55db)]

Upon respawning, players are imbued with the **Panicked Spirit** effect for 60 seconds. As their mortal form temporarily fades, they take on a ghostly appearance, becoming ethereal beings. Swiftly navigating through the world, they are blessed with the effects of Speed II and Slow fall, enabling them to swiftly return to their lost possessions.

**Spiritual Protection and Armor:**
In their spectral state, players must remain vigilant, for danger still lurks. If a player is attacked while embodying the **Panicked Spirit**, they receive the **Spiritual Protection** effect [![spirit_Txt2_scaled_3x_pngcrushed](https://github.com/Rener-py/SCB/assets/47863186/68250326-7098-4cb5-bdeb-162f099003f5)]. This ethereal safeguard, known as "Spiritual Armor," envelops them, providing a temporary armor set that lasts until they retrieve their belongings or the **Panicked Spirit** effect fades away.

**The Enigmatic Spiritual Flower:** [![ezgif-4-8fa799c4fc_scaled_3x_minified](https://github.com/Rener-py/SCB/assets/47863186/1b3dee12-ad82-415f-bd93-9d94d5306bc5)]
At the place of a player's demise, a peculiar spirit flower blooms that exudes an otherworldly aura. This mystical flower clears all spiritual effects just by being near it, inviting players to test their destiny.

**Spooky Advantage or Mysterious Force:**
Breaking the spirit flower may reveal an unexpected boon or peril. A **50%** chance bestows the **Spooky Advantage** effect![spirit_Txt4_scaled_3x_pngcrushed](https://github.com/Rener-py/SCB/assets/47863186/502c0367-55a9-4d67-a905-460f20236a07), gifting players with 15 seconds of healing to mend their wounds and continue their quest. However, the fickle spirits decree that there is also a *5%* chance of a "Mysterious Force" unsettling one's journey. This force lifts players into the air and lets them fall, their fate uncertain.

# This mod can be used to complement other grave mods that contain items on death, such as "Corpse", "GraveStone Mod", "You're in Grave Danger"
