**Spiritual Protection and Armor:**
In their spectral state, players must remain vigilant, for danger still lurks. If a player is attacked while embodying the **Panicked Spirit**, they receive the **Spiritual Protection** effect [![spirit_Txt2_scaled_3x_pngcrushed](https://github.com/Rener-py/SCB/assets/47863186/68250326-7098-4cb5-bdeb-162f099003f5)]. This ethereal safeguard, known as "Spiritual Armor," envelops them, providing a temporary armor set that lasts until they retrieve their belongings or the **Panicked Spirit** effect fades away.

**The Enigmatic Spiritual Flower:** [![ezgif-4-8fa799c4fc_scaled_3x_minified](https://github.com/Rener-py/SCB/assets/47863186/1b3dee12-ad82-415f-bd93-9d94d5306bc5)]
At the place of a player's demise, a peculiar spirit flower blooms that exudes an otherworldly aura. This mystical flower clears all spiritual effects just by being near it, inviting players to test their destiny.

**Spooky Advantage or Mysterious Force:**
Breaking the spirit flower may reveal an unexpected boon or peril. A **50%** chance bestows the **Spooky Advantage** effect![spirit_Txt4_scaled_3x_pngcrushed](https://github.com/Rener-py/SCB/assets/47863186/502c0367-55a9-4d67-a905-460f20236a07), gifting players with 15 seconds of healing to mend their wounds and continue their quest. However, the fickle spirits decree that there is also a *5%* chance of a "Mysterious Force" unsettling one's journey. This force lifts players into the air and lets them fall, their fate uncertain.

# This mod can be used to complement grave mods that contain items on death, such as "Corpse", "GraveStone Mod".
